### Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 6, part 1, was a fun lab because of how we utilized inputs and outputs for sandwich ingredients. I found it funny at first because the idea was so random. It goes to show that use input and output codes for anything you set your mind to, showing creativity in a sense.

* Lab 7, part 2, was another fun lab because it puts together two schedules, relating to philosophers, with no conflict. It would be our job to format the code in a way that allowed the philosophers to have their own proper schedule. I find it interesting how they wouldn't be able to eat at the same time.

* Lab 11 is a favorite of mine, which is a callback to our previous labs that also involved pizza. Knowing myself, I like having a good pizza to eat on special occasions. Our job was to print out code calculating the price per calories of the pizzas from highest to lowest.
